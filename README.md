## Features

### Linus Torvalds Mode

Want to get feedback on your PR in the style of Linux's creator? Use the `--linus-torvalds` flag to receive 
code review feedback in the characteristically passionate and direct style of Linus Torvalds.

```bash
rubber owner repo PR_number --linus-torvalds
```

This mode will:
- Provide brutally honest feedback about code quality
- Point out potential issues with extra... enthusiasm
- Channel Linus's famous attention to performance and maintainability
- Keep technical accuracy while adding some colorful commentary

Note: While entertaining, this mode still provides technically valid code review feedback, just with 
extra... personality.
